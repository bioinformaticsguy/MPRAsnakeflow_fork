**Welcome!**

MPRAsnakeflow pipeline processes sequencing data from Massively Parallel Reporter Assays (MPRAs)
to create count tables for candidate sequences tested in the experiment.

MPRAsnakeflow is built on top of `Snakemake <https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/>`_. Insert your code into the respective folders, i.e. ``scripts``, ``rules``, and ``envs``. Define the entry point of the workflow in the ``Snakefile`` and the main configuration in a ``.yaml`` file.

-------------
Quick Example
-------------

To run MPRAsnakeflow, first activate the snakemake environment with the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    conda activate snakemake


And then run the main workflow with:

.. code-block:: bash

    snakemake --software-deployment-method conda --cores $N --configfile config/example_config.yaml
    

--------
Features
--------

:--software-deployment-method:
  When ```conda`` is set the utility uses mamba to efficiently query repositories and query package dependencies. MPRAsnakeflow also can use containers via apptainer by using ``--software-deployment-method apptainer``. Recommended option: ``--software-deployment-method conda apptainer``
:--cores:
  This utility sets the number of cores (``$N``) to be used by MPRAsnakeflow.
:--configfile:
  This file (e.g., ``config/example_config.yaml``) contains the project, its objects and properties, and sub-properties and its objects that **must** be set before running MPRAsnakeflow.

-------------------
Investigate results
-------------------

After successful execution, you can create a self-contained interactive HTML report with all results via:

.. code-block:: bash

    snakemake --report report.html --configfile conf/example_config.yaml


This report can be forwarded to your collaborators.
An example of a generated report (using some trivial test data) can be seen `here <https://cdn.rawgit.com/snakemake-workflows/rna-seq-kallisto-sleuth/master/.test/report.html>`_.
