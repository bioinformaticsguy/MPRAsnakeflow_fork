Tutorial
=====================

We created jupyter notebooks to get familiar with the workflow and to understand the different steps without struggeling creating your own configuration and use your own data. The notebooks are available in the repository `kircherlab/MPRAsnakeflow_tutorial <https://github.com/kircherlab/MPRAsnakeflow_tutorial>`_. You can run them locally on your laptop/stationary pc or within google colab.
